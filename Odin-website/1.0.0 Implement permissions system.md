### Task properties:

- [ ] Add Documentation

### Notes:

Added a page under super-admin that allows super-admin users to change, add, remove, and reset role permissions.

  

In Frontend Main Pinia store provides a getter called getPermissions. This function takes a key parameter. This key is the permission name. If a specific permission isn't found in the user.permissions object a skeleton object will be returned with all values as false.

  

In Backend Nuxt auto-imports a function called getPermissionsObject. This function takes a token (Either API key or Firebase User token). Returns either a Return object with different keys (Look at getPermissionsObject docs). or an Error string.
